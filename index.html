      <p>
      I was the Operations Manager of a software start up company in San Diego where I was in charge of many aspect of the business: marketing, sales, daily operation, and accounting.  At this position, I worked side by side with the CEO of the company to implement new marketing ideas, manage a team of 15 in the US and a team of 20 in China.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>	
      In the last 3 years, I had the opportunity to start 3 small businesses which allowed me to pursue my passion for animals.  I have done extensive research, developed multiple dog food recipes for Barking Chef, and most importantly, taking great care of all of our customers.  With One Dollar Dog Toy, our toys are not only hand made using recycled fabrics, but thanks to an inspirational company like Toms Shoes, we have continued to donate our toys to local rescue organizations and special charity events.  
      <p>
      <br/>
      I am dedicated and enjoy contributing in different ways to make the daily tasks to be more efficient and timely.  I have always been a team player, organized, computer savvy, and passionate towards things I believe in. With my passion and good work ethic, I believe that I will be a great addition to your team.</p>
